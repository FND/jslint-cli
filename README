http://github.com/FND/jslint-cli

Usage:

Using Douglas Crockford's JavaScript libraries:
* JSLint (http://jslint.com)
* JSON (http://json.org)


Prior Art

More sophisticated wrappers exist in other languages:
http://search.cpan.org/dist/JavaScript-JSLint/bin/jslint
http://www.corybennett.org/projects/
http://code.google.com/p/jslint4java/

However, these are either not suitable for my own purposes or are not being
actively maintained.
